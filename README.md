# Onify Blueprint: Index services from Sokigo Abou

[Abou](https://sokigo.com/produkter/abou/), offered by [Sokigo](https://sokigo.com/), is a widely used e-service platform in Sweden. Abou enables you to create your own e-services or access ready-made e-services shared by other customers. The platform supports case handling either directly in Abou or through integration with other systems.

This Blueprint demonstrates how Onify can index (all) e-services via Abou:s REST API and the `../api/v2/services/GetServices` endpoint. 

> Note: We are using token-based authentication (recommended) for Abou:s REST API.

## Requirements

These are the technical requirements.

* [Onify Hub](https://github.com/onify/install)
* [Onify Hub Functions](https://github.com/onify/hub-functions)
* [Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/)
* [Abou](https://sokigo.com/produkter/abou/)

## Setup

### Abou

To make calls to the Abou API, API users are required, which are administered in the Abou Admin Interface. Token-based authentication means that before making actual API calls, a time-limited token (an encrypted "key" based on JWT, Json Web Token) must be obtained, which then must be included with every API call in the form of a Bearer Authorization Header.

> Note: The user also need access to get the services from Abou.

### Onify

Add the following settings in Onify.

|Key|Value|Type|Tag|Role|
|---|-----|----|---|----|
|abou_url|`***` (eg. `https://services.minkommun.se`)|string|abou||
|abou_username|`***` (eg. `onify`)|string|abou|admin|
|abou_apikey|`***`|password|abou|admin|

> Note: Creating settings via admin interface add a trailing `_` in key. This is required for flow to work.
